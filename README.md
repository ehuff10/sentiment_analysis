# Sentiment Analysis By Ethan Huffman
### Business Understanding
Companies receive an enormous amount of feedback through social media, but manually reviewing every post is unrealistic. Tweets often contain early indicators of customer satisfaction or frustration, and missing negative feedback can lead to unresolved issues or reputational risk. The purpose of this project is to show how machine learning can help automatically identify whether a tweet expresses positive or negative sentiment about a product. This project is designed as a proof of concept for business teams such as product managers, marketing analysts, and customer support teams. By automatically flagging sentiment in real time, these teams can focus their attention on meaningful customer signals rather than sorting through raw social media data.
### Data Understanding 
The dataset used in this project consists of tweets related to Apple and Google products that were manually labeled by human reviewers. Each tweet was classified as expressing positive, negative, or no clear sentiment toward a product. Because neutral tweets are less actionable from a business standpoint, this analysis focuses only on tweets labeled as positive or negative. The tweets are short, informal, and often include slang or abbreviations, closely reflecting how customers communicate online. While this introduces challenges such as sarcasm or limited context, it also makes the dataset well suited for building a realistic sentiment analysis model.
### Data Analysis 
To prepare the data for modeling, tweets without clear sentiment were removed and the remaining text was cleaned and explored. Basic analysis was performed to understand the balance between positive and negative sentiment and to confirm that the dataset contained enough examples for training a reliable model. Since machine learning models cannot interpret raw text directly, the tweet content was transformed into numerical features using a technique called TF-IDF. This approach captures how important individual words are across the dataset, allowing the model to learn common language patterns associated with positive and negative sentiment.
### Modeling
The modeling process began with a simple baseline logistic regression model to establish a starting point for performance. This baseline provided a clear comparison point for evaluating improvements. While the initial model achieved good overall accuracy, it struggled to correctly identify negative sentiment, which is more critical from a business perspective. To address this issue, a class-weighted version of the same model was introduced. By placing more emphasis on negative tweets during training, the updated model improved its ability to detect customer complaints while maintaining strong overall performance. Model evaluation was performed using classification reports and confusion matrices on unseen test data, and the class-weighted model was selected as the final model.
### Conclusion
This project shows how machine learning can be used to quickly understand customer sentiment in social media posts. By analyzing tweet text, the model helps identify whether customers are expressing positive feedback or raising concerns about a product. After testing multiple approaches, a class-weighted model was chosen because it does a better job of catching negative sentiment, which is especially important for businesses trying to respond to customer issues early. The final model was also deployed in a simple app, demonstrating how this analysis could be used in a real-world setting to support better, faster decisions around customer feedback.
